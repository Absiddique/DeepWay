# DeepWay
This project is an aid to the blind. Till date there has been no technological advancement in the way the blind navigate. So I have used deep learning particularly convolutional neural networks so that they can navigate through the streets. 
# My Approach 
## Collecting Training Data
My project is an implementation of CNN's, and we all know that they require a large amount of training data. So the first obstruction in my way was a correclty labeled dataset of images. So I went around my college and recorded a lot of videos(of all types of roads and also offroads).Then I wrote a basic python script to collect save images from the video(I saved 1 image out of every 5, because the consecutive frame are almost identical).
## Training the Model
I made a collection of CNN architectures and trained the model. Then I evaluated the performance of all the models and chose the one with the best accuracy.
The architecture of the best model was:
